# JavaScript30 Challenge - 30 Lightweight Project Practices Built with Vanilla JavaScript

This is a record of my completion of the javascript30 challenge, including all the codes and notes. I'm the type of learner who has to do everything by myself (with the aid of Google, Stack Overflow and documentation, this doesn't count as "other people" üòÅ), so I chose the strategy of taking a look at exactly what other people have done with their demos, and then building it all from scratch. So the code here may be very different from the original tutorial, and it will take testing to see which method is better, but that's my own approach.

In each note, I will briefly explain my thought, as well as newly learned solutions when encountering problems. In addition, the features used in the original tutorial that I did not consider will also be discussed.

Thanks to the author [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos) for the excellent [tutorial](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

Thanks to [Nitish](https://github.com/nitishdayal/JavaScript30) for the text-based guide, I really don't like to watch videos.

Thanks to [GuaHsu](https://github.com/guahsu) for the [demos](http://guahsu.io/JavaScript30/) and the [summaries](https://guahsu.io/categories/JavaScript30/).
